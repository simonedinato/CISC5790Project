    "\n",
    "This section details the steps taken to obtain the \"Alzheimer's Disease Dataset\" from Kaggle, describes its features, and outlines the project’s goals. The dataset, provided by Rabie El Kharoua, contains tabular data with a binary target variable, `Diagnosis`, indicating the presence or absence of Alzheimer’s disease. The goal is to use this data for a binary classification task to predict Alzheimer’s disease using machine learning models."

    "- **Source:** Kaggle, provided by Rabie El Kharoua\n",
    "- **URL:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset)\n",
    "- **Access Date:** March 17, 2025\n",
    "- **License:** The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle under the Kaggle Community Guidelines, which typically allow usage for research and educational purposes. No additional permissions were required for access.\n",
    "- **Rationale for Selection:** This dataset was chosen because it provides a well-labeled, tabular dataset for Alzheimer’s disease classification, suitable for machine learning tasks. It includes 2149 samples with a binary target variable, making it appropriate for a binary classification problem. Its public availability ensures reproducibility, and its tabular format aligns with the project’s focus on traditional machine learning models."
